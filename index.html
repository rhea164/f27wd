            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Suzanne Collins began her career in 1991 writing for children's television, contributing to Nickelodeon
                shows like Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. She also wrote for preschool
                shows like Little Bear and Oswald. Later, she worked on Clifford's Puppy Days and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!
                During her time on Generation O!, she met author James Proimos, who inspired her to try writing
                children's books.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collins found inspiration for her first series, The Underland Chronicles, by contemplating the contrast
                between urban life and the pastoral setting of Alice in Wonderland. The series, starting with Gregor the
                Overlander, became a New York Times bestseller and was sold in 21 foreign territories. Her more
                prominent success came with The Hunger Games Trilogy, an international bestseller with over 100 million
                copies sold worldwide. The first book spent over six years on The New York Times bestseller list and was
                adapted into a highly successful film series by Lionsgate.

            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to her fiction work, Collins released an autobiographical picture book, Year of the Jungle,
                in 2013, addressing her experiences when her father was deployed to Vietnam. Her books, including When
                Charlie McButton Lost Power, have been translated into multiple languages and sold in various
                territories. Suzanne Collins has been recognized with numerous awards, including being named to the TIME
                100 list and receiving the Authors Guild Award for Distinguished Service to the Literary Community in
                2016. The film adaptations of The Hunger Games franchise collectively earned nearly $3 billion
                worldwide.

            "It's the pull between Coryo's head and heart — and the realization that he actually has a beating heart,
            not just a rose-scented lump of coal — that makes the future President Snow very worthy of a 517-page
            prequel."
            --The Washington Post</p>
        <p>
            "A sleek Hunger Games prequel...The plot of the novel rests on deception and pretence, its view of humanity
            bleak; yet Collins's themes of friendship, betrayal, authority and oppression, as well as the extra layers
            of lore about mockingjays and Capitol's history, will please and thrill."
