        <h3>Summary</h3>
        
            <p>
                It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the 
                Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a 
                mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate 
                hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and 
                outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute..
            </p>
            <p>
                The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the 
                female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely 
                intertwined -- every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. 
                Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel 
                for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to 
                survive no matter what it takes.
