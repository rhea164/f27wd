        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p><b>My name is Katniss Everdeen.<br>
            Why am I not dead?<br>
            I should be dead. </b></p>
            <p>
                Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has 
                escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. 
                There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and 
                it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come 
                out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in 
                the carefully laid plans—except Katniss.
            </p>
            <p>
                The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility 
                for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside 
                her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the 
                personal cost.
